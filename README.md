Overview
--------

pebr is a small package providing support functions for my Principles one Epidemiology & Biostatistics class. The functions are neither written with elegance or efficiency in mind. They are a quick and dirty fix.

Installation
------------

``` r
# This package is not available on CRAN

# Install the development version from GitHub
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("dreidpath/pebr")
```

Usage
-----

`library(pebr)` will load the package.
